## About the project

![Banner](images/banner.png)

There are not a lot of information sources for students in Nguyen Tat Thanh Specialized High School. The old information sources are slow, not regularly updated and students can't easily get notified when updates come.

To resolve this problem, alongside adding additional fun stuff and many more information for students, some students in previous years created GitDo, and it had been called an innovation in the job of providing updates to students.

The problem with that GitDo is that it mostly relies on other services and human labour to update information. At the beginning it is not a huge problem. But as the time flies by, those services have started to fail, and people are tired of updating information each time something is updated. GitDo was abandoned.

I - with some support of CYB Technophile's member, resurrected GitDo, making it more independent and more autonomous. I named it GitDo2.
